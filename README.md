## Questions that you came up with
###### -Do we want to create a random array of elements? In the end, for simplicyty sake I intialized my own arrays of ints in main. The same used in the example file.
###### -Do we want to document the program? I went ahead and made comment documentation of how my program works.

## Assumptions you made
###### -We initilaize an array of five elements, but really we are looking for 6 specific elements. 


## The different paths or solutions you contemplated
###### -First thought was to look for specific numbers values (1-6) in the orginal initialized array.
